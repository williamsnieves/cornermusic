## Instructions to run the project

The project was build using the CRA (cli for react apps) in this case to take the advantage of using a quick way to start configuration

In the server directory, we have to run:

### `npm i`

### `npm run dev`

Once the node server is running then we will have to start running the client (root directory)

To install dependencies

### `npm i`

To run the app

### `npm start`

To run the unit tests we have to run (the tests has built using jest and rect testing library)

### `npm test`
